import "webtyp.com/fmt"

// The access-control vocabulary. It lives here, next to ModuleNaming, because a module's
// IDENTITY and the RESOURCE that protects it are the same name — and if they were two
// strings that merely happened to match, they would drift apart in silence: the UI would
// gate a section by one name while the server enforced another. Nobody would see an
// error; a user would simply be shown a page and then denied its data.
//
// It cannot live in the library that implements authentication (webtyp/user): that one
// imports mcp, so mcp would have to import user to type its own field, and user already
// imports mcp. A cycle. And a domain module that only wants to say "my resource is
// service_catalog" must not be forced to drag an OAuth stack behind it.
//
// model is already the zero-dependency contract every layer imports, so the vocabulary is
// free to whoever needs it. Nothing here decides WHO may do WHAT: that is policy, and
// policy belongs to the consumer, written in the consumer's own code.

// Access declares who may reach something — a route, a tool, anything an enforcer guards.
//
// It lives here, not in router or mcp, because BOTH already express these same three states
// and would otherwise each invent their own vocabulary for one idea. router encoded them
// implicitly, as combinations of (Public bool, Resource ""), which made an illegal state
// writable: a route could be marked Public AND carry a Requires, and the enforcer silently
// dropped the permission check. One declared value cannot contradict itself.

	// REJECT a guarded thing with no Resource at registration — loudly, at startup — because
	// authorizing against an empty resource denies every call while looking protected.

// ("raed") compiles and shows up as a denial nobody can explain.
